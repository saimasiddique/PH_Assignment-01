                <p>Hello ! This is Saima Siddique Tashfia. I have recently been graduated and was haunting for an
                    appropriate job. I did some homework and came to the conclusion that web development skills have a
                    great demand in today's job market. So, my mission for the year 2022 is to learn about web
                    development and practice real-life projects. For this, I have joined a course instructed by Jhankar
                    Mahbub. Hoping to be a web developer by the end of the year!!!</p>
